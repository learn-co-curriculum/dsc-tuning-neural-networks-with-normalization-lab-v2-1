    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab on initialization and optimization, let's look at a slightly different type of neural network. This time, we will not perform a classification task as we've done before (Santa vs not santa, bank complaint types), but we'll look at a linear regression problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can just as well use deep learning networks for linear regression as for a classification problem. Do note that getting regression to work with neural networks is a hard problem because the output is unbounded ($\\hat y$ can technically range from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$, and the models are especially prone to exploding gradients. This issue makes a regression exercise the perfect learning case!\n",

    "* Build a nueral network using keras\n",
    "* Normalize your data to assist algorithm convergence\n",
    "* Implement and observe the impact of various initialization techniques"
